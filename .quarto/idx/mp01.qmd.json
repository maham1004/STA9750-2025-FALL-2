Analysis of the platform’s top titles in February, April, June, and August 2025 shows that at least four Hindi films each month captured a spot in the global top 10 charts.\n\nThe total viewership for these hits is impressive. In June 2025, Hindi films collectively amassed 165.4 million hours of global viewing, while April saw 106.9 million hours. February and August tallied 64.3 million and 41.7 million hours, respectively. This corresponds to an estimatedd 6,457,361 Netflix users in India engaging with these films, underscoring India’s influence on global entertainment.\n\nKey highlights from the top performers include:\n\nPushpa 2: The Rise (Feb): nearly 9.5 million estimated views\n\nDhoom Dhaam (Feb): 9.9 million estimated views\n\nJaat (Jun): 9.4 million estimated views\n\nThese figures demonstrate the widespread appeal of Hindi films and provide a meaningful estimate of Netflix’s growing consumer base in India. With multiple top-performing Hindi films each month, Netflix is positioned to continue expanding its engagement in one of the world’s largest streaming markets.\n\n```{r}\n#We will take the top ten india data from the country dataset and \n#use a few different months in 2025. this data will only include \n#non-english top ten titles in india to assume that those are hindi.

Analysis of the platform’s top titles in February, April, June, and August 2025 shows that at least four Hindi films each month captured a spot in the global top 10 charts.\n\nThe total viewership for these hits is impressive. In June 2025, Hindi films collectively amassed 165.4 million hours of global viewing, while April saw 106.9 million hours. February and August tallied 64.3 million and 41.7 million hours, respectively. This corresponds to an estimatedd 6,457,361 Netflix users in India engaging with these films, underscoring India’s influence on global entertainment.\n\nKey highlights from the top performers include:\n\nPushpa 2: The Rise (Feb): nearly 9.5 million estimated views\n\nDhoom Dhaam (Feb): 9.9 million estimated views\n\nJaat (Jun): 9.4 million estimated views\n\nThese figures demonstrate the widespread appeal of Hindi films and provide a meaningful estimate of Netflix’s growing consumer base in India. With multiple top-performing Hindi films each month, Netflix is positioned to continue expanding its engagement in one of the world’s largest streaming markets.\n\n```{r}\n#We will take the top ten india data from the country dataset and \n#use a few different months in 2025. this data will only include \n#non-english top ten titles in india to assume that those are hindi.
